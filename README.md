# üêû Automated Pest Detection System
An AI-powered application that utilizes **YOLOv5** for real-time pest detection in agricultural images, integrated into an interactive web application using **Streamlit**. This system assists farmers and agricultural professionals in early pest detection, promoting sustainable farming practices by reducing crop losses and minimizing pesticide usage.
